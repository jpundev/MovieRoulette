## What is MovieRoulette?

  Movie Roulette is a small project created to solve the crisis of indecisiveness in selecting a movie to watch. Should I watch Comedy? Horror? Action? MovieRoulette randomizes a movie for you given genre(s) and even lists all the relevant details about it. If its not to your liking, you can always re-search another movie! This project is still in heavy development and expect some major changes in the coming future! The details although not directly from IMDB, are very close to it. Using an **API from TheMovieDb**, I obtained relevant movie information that resembles close if not identical to IMDB.
  
  Thank you for using my simple application and I hope it will save you some time!
  
 ## How Do I Use it?
 
 1. Enter your Genre(s) in the search bar and press enter or click submit
 2. Thats it! You can click "Try another search" to re-search another movie!
 
 
 ## Future Improvments
 
 - Have the ability to search with more filters
 - Currently I am randomizing among top 20 popular movies among that genre and I will be expanding to encompass more movies
 - It looks ugly I know I'm sorry, I will work on the aesthetics incuding alignments,color contrast, and designs 
 - Some movies have not been released yet, so searches may include Upcoming movies as well ( filter to include this or not )
 - Include more Error checking to prevent future bugs
 - Make the Codebase more modular
