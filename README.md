## What is MovieRoulette?

  Movie Roulette is a small project created to solve the crisis of indecisiveness in selecting a movie to watch. Should I watch Comedy? Horror? Action? MovieRoulette randomizes a movie for you given genre(s) and even lists all the relevant details about it. If its not to your liking, you can always re-search another movie! This project is still in heavy development and expect some major changes in the coming future! 
  
  Thank you for using my simple application and I hope it will save you some time!
  
 ## How Do I Use it?
 
 1. Enter your Genre(s) in the search bar and press enter or click submit
 2. Thats it! You can click "Try another search" to re-search another movie!
