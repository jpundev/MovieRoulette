## What is MovieRoulette?

  Movie Roulette is a small project created to solve the crisis of indecisiveness in selecting a movie to watch. Should I watch Comedy? Horror? Action? MovieRoulette randomizes a movie for you given genre(s) and even lists all the relevant details about it. If its not to your liking, you can always re-search another movie! This project is still in heavy development and expect some major changes in the coming future!
